# ArchivistBot

This is a tool that uses OpenAI's chatbot with vision to facilitate the archiving of historical documents on the Collective Access database. Users provide photographs of historical documents and brief descriptions and this program creates the corresponding digital record with metadata(e.g. date, content scope and summary, condition).
